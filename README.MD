## What can you do with it?

<br/>

- import bank statements from your local file system or remote REST API
- display statistics like total incomes and outcomes for chosen statements
- edit individual transactions to fix some mistakes or hide private data before sending them elsewhere
- display statements exported in different file formats in a convenient and readable format
- have a centralized database containing the history of your statements from independent banks
- monitor remote sources that provide bank statements from your clients
